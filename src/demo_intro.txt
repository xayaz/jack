 $text[3] = 'Also of considerable importance is the mental state of a slave.

 $text[1] = 'Rebellious slave - a complete punishment for the master. One of the most important tasks of any trainer is unquestioned obedience. This is the only way that you can do further training effectively and get a decent rating.'
 $text[2] = 'The slave''s willingness to obey depends on a variety of factors. It is important to know all of them and understand how positive factors can be produced and maintained. Listen carefully.'
 $text[3] = 'The first thing that comes to mind: fear. You can do anything you want with a slave. In most cases it will not be difficult to intimidate her using pain, abuse and violence. We were able to calculate that the average motivation of fear is almost twice as strong as any other.'
 $text[4] = 'It should however be remembered that fear has its pitfalls. Firstly, you have to be careful with punishments, so as not to cause irreparable physical harm to the girl. But even more important is not to damage her mind.'
 $text[5] = 'Whenever you punish a slave, she will not only start to fear you, but her dissatisfaction will also grow. This is a direct way to drive slave into a deep depression. Without positive motivation, training a slave will be very difficult because her fear and self-pity will stop the girl from focusing on her training.'
 $text[6] = 'In addition to lowering her mood, fear has an additional dark side. We call it angst or despair. Angst - a destructive terror emanating from a misunderstanding and rejection of fear. If a slave gets punished without feeling guilt - her angst inevitably grows.'
 $text[7] = 'Sensitive girls may fall into angst simply because of her bad mood. When a slave is extremely gentle, fear and angst will lead her to depression faster. Whenever you consider punishing your slave, do not only consider the degree of her guilt, but also her sensitivity.'
 $text[8] = 'Angst destroys personality. Under its influence a slave begin to lose her temper and self-confidence, gradually breaking her will. In the early stages it can help, but in the end it will only lower her rating. Be careful.'
 $text[9] = 'To get rid of angst, try to ensure that your slave is elated. Satisfied girls will gradually forget their angst. In addition, it will be much easier to learn new material and she will concentrate more during training.'
 !cоntented - о is a russian letter, to prevent bad thing happening
 $text[10] = 'At the same time, a slave that is cоntented with life will quickly forget about her fear meaning that you will have to develop other sources of respect so that she obeys you. Namely: habit, taming, awareness and devotion.'
 $text[11] = 'Let''s start with habit. It is no secret that people can obey orders just because they used to do it. Every time a slave obeys your instructions and rules, her habit of slavery slightly increases. Gradually, the slave will just forget that she once was free.'
 $text[12] = 'While boosting the generation of habits is difficult, try to be strict towards your slave, it will speed up the process. A proud personality will develop habits slowly, but habits gradually makes them forget about their pride. On a par with the humiliation, of course.'
 $text[13] = 'A good foundation for obedience is a reasonable understanding of slave''s position. Try to explain to the slave that loyalty will be rewarded, and the resistance will lead to the inevitable punishment. Mind promotes reasonable obedience, but a strong will can interfere with accepting her fate.'
 $text[14] = 'Reasonable obedience can be achieved not only by direct subordination, but also through reasonable rewards. By rewarding a slave, you do not just improve her mood, you also make her realize that obedient behavior leads to good treatment.'
 $text[15] = 'Be extremely careful though. Rewarding a slave beyond her merits means you do not only develop her obedience, but also make her spoiled. A spoiled slave is less controllable and will always require some kind of positive incentive. Otherwise, she will start to get upset and fall into despair.'
 $text[16] = 'In addition to reasonable obedience, there''s also an instinctive obedience, when your slave subconsciously feel your superiority and strives to please you. Less temperamental people are more prone to this type of obedience.'
 $text[17] = 'To develop a slave''s instinct you can use punishments. When non-compliance causes pain, obedience will become a reflex. Another way to develop instinctive obedience is using sexual desire. People are subconsciously drawn to the source of pleasure.'
 $text[18] = 'The final goal of raising her obedience is make her accept slave morality. When slave accepts her position with all of her heart and sincerely wants to serve her master, she has reached a moral growth. This source of loyalty is doubly valuable because it is the most reliable.'
 $text[19] = 'Slave morality begins to appear when on the one hand the slave satisfied with her position and is in a good mood, and on the other she has developed a habit as well as instinct and reasonable obedience. Fear is not critical, but it is difficult to build morale with it.'
 $text[20] = 'Acknowledged whip masters are able to sharply raise their slaves morale through catharsis: a special state of enlightenment, the moment of truth, comes in the second of highest pain or pleasure. But this technique is available only for the best.'
 $text[21] = 'Summing up, we can isolate some simple rules of training: punish your slave for misdeeds, but only comparable to the guilt. Reward your slave for good behavior, but only on merit. Give her time to gradually get used to your rules. Control her orgasms and keep watch over her mood.'
 $text[22] = 'I will now say a few words about the superiority and physical resistance. It will be much easier to subdue the girl who initially feels that you are stronger and, on the other hand, if she feels that she is stronger than you, she will not want to obey.'
 $text[23] = 'Whether or not she will feel your superiority is influenced by several factors. First - of course - your physical strength. Second - your spiritual strength and charisma. Third - the experience of command, the ability to dominate. Finally - your appearance. Good looks make it easier to submit to you.'
 $text[24] = 'But the slave''s personal qualities are also important. A strong character, high emotionality and, of course, the slave''s pride will prevent her to feel your superiority. Also, watch out if she does feel smarter than you, thinking that she can outwit you. She will be less inclined to obey.'
 $text[25] = 'If your superiority is low, she might put up a fight. In response to your attempts to punish or rape her, your slave will defend herself by force. If she can beat you, the consequences can be dire. But your victory will confirm your superiority.'
 $text[26] = 'Superiority itself, even if very high, does not guarantee your orders are getting executed, but accelerates the development of obedience and reduces the likelihood of physical confrontation. Keep yourself in good physical shape, develop a commanding voice and keep a good physical appearance.'

 $text[1] = 'Let''s talk more about the punishments and rewards. In the second lecture we talked about angst and spoiling, but I will repeat myself. Punishing a slave too much - we feed angst. Rewarding her with something she does not deserve - we pamper and spoil the slave, although improve her mood.'
 $text[2] = 'It is important to understand the key point: the merits and sins of the slave differ from case to case. You should understand what made her act in a certain way. Consider two examples to make it more obvious:'
 $text[3] = 'Suppose that you take an innocent girl that is not accustomed to mistreatment and tell her to mate with tribal bull for your entertainment. In her eyes, refusing to do that is not a serious offense, as your demand is far above what she is willing to do.'
 $text[4] = 'If you brutally punish the girl for disobeying such an order, it will inevitably lead to angst, as she does not understand why the rejection of such a vile act can be regarded as something impermissible. But over time, things will change.'
 $text[5] = 'If your slave is already trained and rather obedient, she will actually realize her sin. Rejection of the same action with a bull from the already prepared girl should cause a much more severe reaction from you.'
 $text[6] = 'Same story with the rewards. Do not only evaluate the result, but keep the slave''s personality in mind. Suppose your nearly untrained slave has agreed to a lesson on deep throating. Even if the result is not perfect, she had to agree to it and overcome her resistance. She should be rewarded properly.'
 $text[7] = 'On the contrary, even if a slave is doing something very well because she already knows how to do it, but is completely effortless - she does not deserve a reward. You may even consider punishing her.'
 $text[8] = 'Always evaluate the slave''s merits and sins on a five-point system. And also evaluate the power of rewards and punishments. Always keep in mind: She gets what she deserves.'
 $text[9] = 'But remember that what I said is for general guidance only. There are cases when it makes sense to punish or reward the slave more than she deserves, even at the risk of angst or spoil. Decisions are always made by you, use your experience and intuition.'
 $text[10] = 'Move on to the more specific types and forms of rewards and punishments. Any impact derives its strength from the slave''s specific desires and fears.'
 $text[11] = 'Punishments are based on pain, feelings of helplessness, disgust, shame, psychological vulnerability, phobias of blood, darkness, spiders, water, fire and other things.'
 $text[12] = 'Rewards may be based on the need for approval, desire for comfort, a passion for luxury, sexual pleasure or even food if she a sweet tooth.'
 $text[13] = 'Each slave has her own strengths and weaknesses, her passions and phobias. Learn what she wants and what she is afraid of, and then use it for your own purposes - it is the key gain control over a slave rapidly.'
 $text[14] = 'Imagine that you have to bring up the fearless, battle-hardened warrior. Surely you will not be able to break her will by flogging or with the sight of blood. But you can try to put pressure on her psychologically or tie her up so that she feels helpless in front of you.'
 $text[15] = 'Do not forget that a person gets used to everything. Habit is developed as to the types of exposure, and to specific types of punishments and rewards. Exceptions are only slave''s innate phobia and passion. As for the rest, be creative and try not to repeat them too often.'
 $text[16] = 'Verbal rewards and punishments have one very significant advantage: they do not take a lot of time and effort, neither yours nor your slaves. However, this is the all the upsides this method has. Praising and swearing quickly lose strength, as well as threats and promises if you don''t take action.'
 $text[17] = 'You can punish a slave on the spot without any available tools. It''s quick and practical, but remember that tools increase the efficiency of punishments. In addition, beatings can leave bruises on the girl. Gradually, the wounds will heal, but even the traces will reduce her rating and charm.'
 $text[18] = 'To inflict pain, try to use at least the minimum amount of tools. For spanking, in ascending order: slippers, belt, cane, lash and whip. Be careful when using either lash or whip, as the scars may remain forever. A lot depends on your skill.'
 $text[19] = 'A great advantage of binding your slave is that it means less effort. You punish your slave with arbitrarily long torment. Nevertheless, bondage on average is slightly less effective than physical punishment of the same level.'
 $text[20] = 'If your slave is aroused - reward her by caressing her. She will not lose energy herself, moreover, a good massage can even add energy to her. But keep in mind that her arousal will only go down if she cums. Otherwise you will just raise her arousal even more.'
 $text[21] = 'To save your own energy, you can reward your slave with free time. If you just give her a rest, you may be able to use her remaining energy tomorrow. But your slave will be even more joyful if you give her the opportunity to have fun and play games.'
 $text[22] = 'If you have some extra sparks and you are not afraid that your slave may gain weight, you can reward her with sweets. Rare dishes can be very expensive, but even they can become boring if eaten many times in a row. When you reward slave with sweets, try to add variety.'
 $text[23] = 'Some punishments may require special equipment or rooms. For the examination, we do not provide torture tools and units, so you will have to manage with the minimum.'
 $text[24] = 'For some rewards it may be necessary to take the slave to the city. During examination training, you must not leave the walls of the guild, so that these rewards will also not be available. Nevertheless, we are confident that you have enough opportunities for training.'

Assistants can help with the housework, entertain you, keep track for the slave and animals and even teach your slave.'
 $text[2] = 'The Guild does not provide assistants for the exam, so you will have to manage on your own. Of course, you can use the slave for housekeeping, if she is sufficiently obedient and has the necessary skills.'
 $text[3] = 'The first thing to remember is your personal and slave''s hygiene. Dirt contributes to disease and reduces mood. In addition, a dirty slave receives greater damage from fights and tortures, as injuries might get infected.'
 $text[4] = 'Dirt accumulates over time and from many activities, especially those related to working, cleaning, cooking or dirty sex. To maintain hygiene, you should occasionally wash yourself. If you do not have a private bathroom, you will have to go to the onsen.'
 $text[5] = 'The Guild has the bathroom as a standard room, so you do not need to go into the city. You can bathe alone or together with the slave. In the second case, only she will spend her energy, but will wash you both. In addition, this should elevate your mood.'
 $text[6] = 'Your home also gets dirty. Gradually it accumulates dust and dirt, stale clothes, dirty dishes and so on. Do not forget to carry out regular cleaning so as not to reduce the mood of all the inhabitants of the house. And remember, the bigger the mess at hand - the more difficult it will be to clean up.'

 $text[8] = 'Watch the weight of your slave. You should ensure that she is neither too fat nor too starved. Pick up portions of food so that the weight of your slave remains stable.'
 $text[9] = 'An important thing is the personal characteristics of the metabolism. A slave with a good metabolism is capable to absorb about twice as many calories as regular without harm and will restore health through diet. A girl with a weak metabolism will quickly gain excess weight and it will be difficult for her to lose weight.'
 $text[10] = 'If you are not a born cook or butler, doing housework is a heavy burden on your mood. However, until you have an assistant, you should do it yourself as giving this task to slave may not be appropriate, especially if she does not have enough energy.'
